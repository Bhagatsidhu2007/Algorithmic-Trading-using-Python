# Algorithmic-Trading-using-Python
This project implements and back tests SMAs to generate both a long/short crossover strategy and a long-bias variant (avoiding short positions), shifts signals to avoid look-ahead bias, calculates daily and cumulative returns, and visualizes strategy performance against a buy-and-hold benchmark.
